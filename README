Contains example of algortims in C++

1) NetflixColaboration - Sample data of Netflix users (100k) are used to predict the movie new user might like. I use correlation coefficient for this. If coefficient between two use is 1 then it means two users are highly likely to have same test in movies.

2)Sorting algorithm - Different sorting algorithm is used here.
                    a) Quicksort
                    b) MergeSort
                    c) Insertion Sort
